Q: which hardware is supported?
A: look at http://ctflasher.sourceforge.net

Q: which types of flashproms are supported?
A: do a "cat /proc/flashprom/supported_types"

Q: i can't load the module. i get a message like:
   "ct.o: init_module: Input/output error"
A: look into the syslog messages. you will find out the reason:
   "May 16 23:40:03 lap-dpf kernel: ctflash: c't flasher not found!"
   for using this program you need a special hardware. look at:
   http://www.heise.de/ct/ftp/projekte/flasher/default.shtml

Q: i have installed the hardware and the hardware has been detected. but at 
   "cat /proc/ctflasher/info" i always get "manufacturer: unknown".
   what's wrong?
A: there are several things. first, i don't support all manufacturers. why? 
   i don't have all flashtypes. if i get a new one, i will test it immediately.
   another problem can depend on the configuration of your bios. in some bios
   you can disable/select the io of the isa slots. enable the right io.
   be careful of other hardware. i got problems with a on board scsi controler.
   at flashproms with a 28 inside the number (intel p28f001) you must enable 12volt.

Q: i have used the program and now my computer is damaged, my harddisk is
   erased, i'm out of work, my wife is having a baby, ....
   where can i send the bill?
A: /dev/null
 
Q: why verify isn't supported?
A: a verify is included and runs automatically at any operation.
   to doublecheck you can use "cmp /proc/ctflasher/data datafile"

Q: how can i check flashchip is propper read?
A: use cmp,strings or hexdump to check the datafile.

Q: i have inserted a 128KB flash in my NIC (network interface card), but somethings
   is wrong...
A: read the output from .../info

   work: # cat /proc/via-rhine-flash/device_0/info
   hardware:     via-rhine
   manufacturer:   WINBOND
   flashtype:      W29C010M   1 Mbit (128K x 8-bit) (sure)
   protected:      unknown
   romsize reduced to 64 kbytes because of hardware restrictions
   work: #

   your NIC only supports flashproms up to 64KB.

Q: if i write data to a flash, should i erase the flash first
   ("cat /proc/ctflasher/erase")?
A: no. if you copy the data to the flash ("cat image >/proc/ctflasher/data"),
   the program will first check the flash. if the flash is not erased, the
   program will do it before writing the data into the flash.

Q: can i damage my computer hardware, if i send a file to the device, which
   is bigger than the flash?
A: test it! the program will only write the amount of data to the flash,
   which is configured in flash_data.h. if you send more to the device, the
   program will cut the rest and you will get an error message like

   work:/ # cat /dev/urandom >/proc/ctflasher/data
   cat: write error: No space left on device
   work:/ #

Q: where is the gui?
A: this program is simple, fast, good. for using it you don't need any additional
   program. people, who really needs this flasher, don't ask for a gui.
