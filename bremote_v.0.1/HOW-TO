This is the HOW-TO file for bremote v.0.1. It is a SonyEricsson T610
Bluetooth remote control application for Xine, (c) by Niko Mauno 2004.


STARTING XINE WITH BREMOTE:
===========================

Below is a description of how to use the bremote application:

First of all, the Bluez Bluetooth subsystem should be running, if not, 
init it e.g. by starting the BlueZ hci daemon:

	hcid


Second, use Bluetooth inquiry to discover the bluetooth device address 
(bdaddr) of your SonyEricsson phone:

	hcitool scan --flush


Then use the btxine script to launch xine with bremote:

	btxine (file) (bdaddr)

(file) = full path to your movie or audio file, e.g. /mnt/cdrom/test.avi
(bdaddr) = Bluetooth device address, e.g. 11:22:33:44:55:66


On the first Bluetooth connection establishment between your Linux and 
SonyEricsson phone, You will be prompted for PIN code. Use e.g. the 
default 1234 for both ends, and 'accept' connection from Linux on your 
SonyEricsson phone.
