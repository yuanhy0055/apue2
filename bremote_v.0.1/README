This is the README file for bremote v.0.1. It is a SonyEricsson T610 
Bluetooth remote control application for Xine, (c) by Niko Mauno 2004. 


Requirements:
=============

1) bluez

The Official Linux Bluetooth protocal stack, Bluez, is required by the 
Bluetooth remote control application. Bluez can be acquired from 
http://www.bluez.org/. You should probably install at least bluez-libs 
and bluez-utils.

A USB Bluetooth dongle was used on author's system. For USB Bluetooth 
dongles, a character special file must be created, if it's not already 
there. E.g:

	mknod /dev/ttyUB0 c 216 0

2) xine

Xine is a free (gpl-licensed) high-performance, portable and reusable 
multimedia playback engine. bremote application requires xine-lib (Xine 
core engine) and xine-ui (Xine frontend). They both can be acquired from 
http://xinehq.de/.

A passwd file that is in this folder must be placed in the 
.xine-directory. E.g:

	cp ./passwd /root/.xine

Where the destination path may naturally vary depending where xine-ui is 
installed on your system. The user:password combination is by default 
set to "root:root". The user:password combination can be changed less 
predictable by changing them in both the passwd-file and in the 
bremote.c file [line which says: strcpy(inet_buf_out, "identify 
root:root\n");]

3) aumix and eject

The bremote application uses also aumix and eject applications. It 
would be good to have at least the aumix application on your system, in 
order for the volume control to work.


Version information:
====================

The bremote application was tested and run on Linux Fedora Core 2 
kernel version 2.6.8-1.521 (The application should run on any 2.6 
kernel and probably on [most] 2.4 kernels). 

The software versions used were xine-lib-1-rc6a, xine-ui-0.99.2, 
bluez-libs-2.10, bluez-utils-2.10, aumix version 2.8, eject 
version 2.0.13.
